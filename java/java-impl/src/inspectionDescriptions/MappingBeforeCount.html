Reports redundant <code>Stream</code> API calls like <code>map()</code>, or <code>boxed()</code>
right before the <code>count()</code> call.
<p>
  Such calls don't change the final count, so could be removed. It's possible that the code relies on
  a side effect from the lambda inside such a mapping call. However, relying on side effects inside
  the stream chain is extremely bad practice. There are no guarantees that the call will not be 
  optimized out in future Java versions.
</p>
<p><b>Example:</b></p>
<pre><code>
  // map() call is redundant
  long count = list.stream().filter(s -> !s.isEmpty()).map(s -> s.trim()).count();
</code></pre>
